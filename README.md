# 🔐 ECDH Prototype using Python's Cryptography Library

This project demonstrates a simple prototype of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol using the `cryptography` library in Python.

---

## ✨ What It Does

- Generates elliptic curve private/public key pairs for two parties: **Daniel** and **Yinon**.
- Computes a **shared secret** for both sides using ECDH.
- Verifies that both parties derived the **same shared key**.
